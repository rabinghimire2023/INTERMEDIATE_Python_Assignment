## Introduction

### 1. *args and **kwargs
In Python, *args and **kwargs are used to accept an arbitrary number of positional and keyword arguments, respectively, in a function. The *args allows the function to accept a variable number of non-keyword arguments, while **kwargs allows the function to accept a variable number of keyword arguments. We will explore how to use these features to perform various tasks, such as calculating the sum of numbers and concatenating strings.

### 2. Map, Filter, and Reduce
The map, filter, and reduce functions are powerful tools for working with lists and other iterable objects in Python. They provide a concise way to perform operations on elements in a list and return the results. We will implement functions using map to apply a function to each element of a list, filter to select elements based on a condition, and reduce to perform cumulative operations on a list.

### 3. Ternary Operators
Ternary operators are a concise way to write simple conditional expressions in Python. They allow us to write one-liner if-else statements and are particularly useful when dealing with simple decision-making tasks. We will use ternary operators to determine whether a number is odd or even, check for leap years, find the larger number among three, and determine if a number is prime.

### 4. Collections
Collections in Python provide specialized data structures that extend the capabilities of built-in data types like lists, dictionaries, and sets. In one of the assignments, we will work with anagrams, grouping them together based on rearranged letters. We will explore how to use collections to efficiently solve this problem.

### 5. Comprehension
List, dictionary, and set comprehensions are powerful constructs in Python for creating new collections from existing ones in a concise and readable way. They allow us to perform filtering, transformation, and combination operations in a single line of code. We will use list and dictionary comprehensions to extract specific elements from lists and dictionaries, and set comprehension to collect unique elements.

### 6. Exception Handling
Exception handling in Python allows us to handle errors gracefully and prevent program crashes. In this section, we will write code that handles various types of exceptions, such as ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, and ValueError, with custom error messages. We will also create our own custom exceptions for specific scenarios.

### 7. File I/O
File Input/Output (I/O) operations are essential when working with external data sources. We will read data from CSV and JSON files, perform data processing, and create new files with the desired data. We will also implement a function to search for specific keywords in a log file.

### 8. Object-Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to model real-world entities and provides mechanisms for code reuse and organization. We will create classes to represent a University and a Banking System. We will use inheritance and encapsulation to structure our classes and implement polymorphism by defining common methods.
